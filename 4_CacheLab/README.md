# Cache simulator

# Discription 
#### This lab will help you understand the impact that cache memories can have on the performance of your Cprograms
you will write a cache simulator in csim.c that takes a valgrind memory trace as input,simulates the hit/miss behavior of a cache memory on this trace,and outputs the total number of hits,misses, and evictions.

>## Running the autograding 
>
>#### Before running the autograders,
>compile your code: linux> make
>
>*Check the correctness of your simulator: linux> ./test-csim
