# Cache simulator

# Discription 
#### This lab will help you understand the impact that cache memories can have on the performance of your Cprograms
you will write a cache simulator in csim.c that takes a valgrind memory trace as input,simulates the hit/miss behavior of a cache memory on this trace,and outputs the total number of hits,misses, and evictions.

>## Running the autograding 
>
>#### Before running the autograders,
>compile your code: linux> make
>
>*Check the correctness of your simulator: linux> ./test-csim

3. cachelab-handout : my solution for lab
     - cachelab.c : helper functions
     - cachelab.h : header file
     - csim-ref*  : The executable reference cache simulator
     - test-csim* : Tests The cache simulator
     - test-trans.c : Tests The transpose function
     - tracegen.c : Helper program used by test-trans
     - traces/ Trace files : used by test-csim.c
